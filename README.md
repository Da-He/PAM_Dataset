### Description
This dataset contains 268 PAM images of bodhi and magnolia leaf veins. You may use this dataset to build your projects like PAM enhancement methods.

The raw data were collected with the shape of 256x256x180 from the acquisition card and stored in .npy format. You could load these raw data using NumPy. The raw data could be downloaded from two links: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P2vdRAw88szLD9E8Dp1FJaBfVxOKxQ5p/view?usp=share_link), [Baidu Yun 百度云](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pQrkY-fKwbY9LQKwdykBNQ?pwd=gn6g)(password: gn6g).

As the common display, the maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images based on the raw data were also generated (i.e., with the shape of 256x256). These MAP images were rescaled to 8-bit grayscale .png files. MAP images could be downloaded from: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VpKwhuHAEb-iX8XPQ5PP7K_k3P4jMpcX/view?usp=share_link), [Baidu Yun 百度云](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZeZ7RDIyW8bVWg4NtPRw5Q?pwd=9l1r)(password: 9l1r).
